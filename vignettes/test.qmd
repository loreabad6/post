In R, vector data cube structures are supported in the form of array objects by the `{stars}` package and as tabular objects[^1] with the `{cubble}` package.
`{sf}` is used both by cubble and stars to handle the spatial dimensions.
Finally, both stars and cubble support certain `{tidyverse}` functions. 

[^1]: Other packages also support spatio-temporal objects such as `{sftime}`, and further support will be implemented while `post` gets developed.
