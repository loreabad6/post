In R, vector data cube structures are supported in the form of array objects by the `{stars}` package and as tabular objects[^1] with the `{cubble}` package.
`{sf}` is used both by cubble and stars to handle the spatial dimensions.
Finally, both stars and cubble support certain `{tidyverse}` functions. 

[^1]: Other packages also support spatio-temporal objects such as `{sftime}`, and further support will be implemented while `post` gets developed.

Data cubes are multi-dimensional data structures.
The most commonly known data cubes, particularly in Earth observation (EO), are **raster data cubes**. 
Raster data cubes are structures frequently used to organise time series of satellite imagery, gridded climate data, etc.
They have minimum two spatial dimensions: *longitude* or *x* and *latitude* or *y*. 
The remainder dimensions can either be *time*, or other dimension such as *bands* for EO data.
